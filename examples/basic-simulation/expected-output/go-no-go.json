  "rationale": "The product meets 3 out of 4 launch criteria. User satisfaction (0.72) exceeds minimum threshold (0.70). Churn risk (0.18) is below maximum acceptable (0.20). Day 7 retention (0.85) exceeds target (0.80). However, viral coefficient (0.9) falls short of target (1.0), indicating the product won't achieve viral growth without additional referral mechanics. Despite missing viral target, the product shows strong core metrics and can launch successfully with post-launch focus on improving referral features.",
